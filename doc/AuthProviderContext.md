# Authentication System Documentation

## Key Fix
The main issue was that you were trying to parse the API response as JSON, but the server is returning the JWT token directly as plain text. I modified the code to use the response text directly as the token without trying to parse it as JSON.

## Authentication Flow Explained

### AuthContext & AuthProvider
- These create a system to manage authentication state throughout your app
- The AuthProvider wraps your entire application, making auth functions and state available everywhere
- It stores the authentication token in both React state and localStorage (so it persists across page refreshes)

### useAuth Hook
- This is a custom hook that makes it easy to access authentication context from any component
- It provides `{ token, user, login, logout }` to your components

### Login Process
1. When a user submits credentials, your app sends them to the API using Basic Authentication
2. The server verifies credentials and returns a JWT token
3. Your app stores this token and extracts user information from it

### JWT Token
- JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure way to represent claims between parties
- It contains encoded information about the user and permissions
- I added a `parseJwt` function to decode this information

### Protected Routes
- The `ProtectedRoute` component in your App.js checks if a token exists
- If no token is found, it redirects to the login page

## Additional Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- Added more specific error messages and improved error capturing

### Comprehensive Logging
- Added console logs throughout the auth flow to help you debug issues

### JWT Decoding
- Added functionality to extract user information from the JWT

### Clearer Token Handling
- Fixed the token extraction to work with your school's API response format

## Next Steps
1. Try this updated code and check the console logs to see exactly what's happening during the login process
2. You might want to expand the user data extracted from the JWT - I've included the basics but you can add more fields based on what's available in the token
3. Consider adding a loading state to your protected routes to handle the brief moment when the app is checking if a token exists
4. For security, you might want to verify the token's expiration and implement auto-logout when tokens expire

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

## 🔍 How does it work?
Here's the breakdown:

```js
export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext); // Get the context value

  // If used outside the <AuthProvider>, context will be null
  if (!context) {
    console.error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }

  return context; // Return { token, user, login, logout }
};
```

## ✅ What it gives you
Anywhere in your app (as long as you're inside <AuthProvider>), you can do this:

jsx
Copy
const { user, token, login, logout } = useAuth();
No need to write useContext(AuthContext) each time.

## 💥 Why the error check?
js
Copy
if (!context) {
  throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
}
If you accidentally use this hook outside the provider, it'll throw a clear error instead of silently failing — helps with debugging and avoids weird bugs.

## 🧠 TL;DR
useAuth is a custom hook that:

Gives you direct access to your auth state/functions

Makes your code cleaner

Ensures you're using it in the right place
