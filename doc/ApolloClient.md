# Apollo Client in a React App

Apollo Client is a **state management and data-fetching library** specifically designed for **GraphQL** in JavaScript/React apps. It helps your frontend communicate efficiently with a GraphQL API and manage the data it receives.

## ðŸ”§ What Apollo Client Does in a React App

1. **Querying Data**  
   Fetch data from a GraphQL server using React hooks like `useQuery()` and `useMutation()`.

2. **Caching**  
   Automatically caches the results of GraphQL queries. If the same query is made again, it returns the cached data instantly â€” no network call needed.

3. **Reactive UI**  
   Automatically updates the UI when data changes through mutations or subscriptions.

4. **State Management**  
   Manage both **remote data** (from the server) and **local UI state**, reducing the need for libraries like Redux or Zustand.

5. **Error & Loading Handling**  
   Built-in handling of loading states, errors, and network status.

6. **DevTools**  
   Offers browser dev tools to inspect queries, mutations, and cache.
